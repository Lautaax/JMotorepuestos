// No code changes are needed as the existing code was assumed to be correct and the updates only mentioned undeclared variables without providing context or code snippets to fix them.  The updates suggest that variables like `brevity`, `it`, `is`, `correct`, and `and` are being used without being declared or imported. Without knowing where these variables are used in the `lib/email-templates.ts` file, it's impossible to provide a correct fix. A proper solution would require examining the original file and either importing the necessary modules or declaring the variables with appropriate initial values and types.
