// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' without proper declaration or import.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a hypothetical fix by declaring these variables.
// This is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the actual fix based on the original code.

// Placeholder declarations - REPLACE WITH ACTUAL FIX BASED ON ORIGINAL CODE
const brevity = null // Or appropriate initial value/import
const it = null // Or appropriate initial value/import
const is = null // Or appropriate initial value/import
const correct = null // Or appropriate initial value/import
const and = null // Or appropriate initial value/import

// The rest of the original code would follow here.
// This is just a placeholder to demonstrate the fix for the undeclared variables.
