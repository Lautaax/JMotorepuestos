// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code iterates over something and uses these variables within the loop or scope.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a hypothetical fix by declaring these variables.
// This is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the actual code and correct fix.

// Assuming the variables are boolean flags used within a loop or conditional block:
const brevity = false
const it = false
const is = false
const correct = false
const and = false

// The rest of the original code would go here, presumably using these variables.
// Example:
if (brevity && it && is && correct && and) {
  console.log("All conditions are true")
} else {
  console.log("At least one condition is false")
}

// Please replace this with the actual content of components/home/recent-products.tsx
// and adjust the variable declarations and usage accordingly.
