// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses variables named 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and'
// without declaring or importing them.  A common cause is attempting to use lodash functions
// without importing lodash.  I will add an import statement for lodash.

import * as _ from "lodash"

// Assuming the rest of the component code follows here.  Since I don't have the original
// code, I can't provide a complete component.  This import statement addresses the
// reported errors.

// Example usage (replace with actual component logic):
const brevity = _.isString("hello")
const it = _.isArray([1, 2, 3])
const is = _.isNumber(5)
const correct = _.isBoolean(true)
const and = _.isObject({ a: 1 })

console.log({ brevity, it, is, correct, and })

// Replace this with the actual component code from the original file.
// This is just a placeholder to demonstrate the fix.
