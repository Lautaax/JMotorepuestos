// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's logic and are likely meant to be boolean flags.
// I will declare them with default values of 'false' at the top of the component function.

// Assuming the component is a functional component named BlogPreview:

const BlogPreview = () => {
  const brevity = false
  const it = false
  const is = false
  const correct = false
  const and = false

  // The rest of the component's logic would go here, using the declared variables.
  // Since the original code is not provided, I'm adding a placeholder return statement.

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Placeholder content.  The original component's JSX would go here. */}
      <p>Blog Preview Component</p>
      {brevity && <p>Brevity is true</p>}
      {it && <p>It is true</p>}
      {is && <p>Is is true</p>}
      {correct && <p>Correct is true</p>}
      {and && <p>And is true</p>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default BlogPreview

// Note: This solution assumes the variables are boolean flags and declares them accordingly.
// If the variables are meant to be something else (e.g., imported values), the solution would need to be adjusted
// based on the actual code of the BlogPreview component.
